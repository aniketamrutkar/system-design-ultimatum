## Database Tradeoffs

### SQL vs NoSQL

| Aspect | SQL (Relational) | NoSQL | When to Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Data Model** | Structured, fixed schema with relations | Flexible schema, document/key-value/graph | Use SQL for complex relationships; NoSQL for flexible, rapidly changing data |
| **ACID Compliance** | Strong ACID guarantees | Often eventual consistency (some offer ACID) | Use SQL for financial transactions; NoSQL for high throughput, eventual consistency OK |
| **Scalability** | Vertical scaling (scale up); horizontal with sharding complexity | Horizontal scaling built-in | Use SQL for moderate scale; NoSQL for massive scale-out needs |
| **Query Flexibility** | Rich SQL queries, joins, aggregations | Limited queries; optimized for specific access patterns | Use SQL for ad-hoc analytics; NoSQL for known access patterns |
| **Performance** | Slower writes due to ACID overhead; optimized reads with indexes | Fast writes; read performance depends on data model | Use SQL for read-heavy with complex queries; NoSQL for write-heavy workloads |
| **Examples** | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle | MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis | |

**Why Choose SQL:**
- Need strong consistency and ACID transactions (banking, e-commerce orders)
- Complex queries with multiple joins (reporting, analytics)
- Well-defined schema that doesn't change frequently
- Team expertise with SQL

**Why Choose NoSQL:**
- Need to scale horizontally to handle massive traffic (social media feeds, IoT)
- Schema flexibility for rapidly evolving features (startups, prototyping)
- Simple key-value or document lookups (user profiles, session storage)
- Geographic distribution with eventual consistency acceptable

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- SQL: Consistency + Complex Queries ↔ Harder to scale horizontally
- NoSQL: Scalability + Flexibility ↔ Limited query capabilities, eventual consistency

### Common Databases: When to Use What

| DB | Model | Strengths | Best For | Watchouts |
|----|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **DynamoDB** | Managed key-value/document | Serverless, predictable latency, auto-scaling, TTLs | Massive scale key-value lookups, bursty traffic, IoT/session/user settings | Hot partitions cost $$, limited query patterns, single-table design learning curve |
| **Cassandra** | Wide-column (AP) | Linear write scaling, multi-region friendly, tunable consistency | Write-heavy time-series/logs/metrics, large append-only datasets | Eventual consistency by default, partition-key centric modeling, tombstone/GC tuning |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational | Strong ACID, rich SQL/JSONB, extensions (PostGIS/FDW), mature tooling | OLTP with complex queries/joins, moderate scale analytics, transactional workloads | Vertical limits; sharding/replica mgmt needed at very high scale; tune vacuum/autovacuum |
| **MySQL** | Relational | Battle-tested, easy ops, good replication, wide ecosystem | Simpler OLTP, LAMP stacks, read-heavy with replicas | Manual sharding at scale, fewer advanced SQL features vs Postgres, replica lag considerations |
| **MongoDB** | Document | Flexible schema, rich queries and indexes, good developer velocity | Evolving schemas (content/user profiles), nested documents, moderate real-time reads | Data integrity relies on schema discipline; multi-doc transactions newer; large/hot docs hurt |
| **Neo4j** | Graph | Native graph traversals, expressive Cypher queries | Highly connected data (social, fraud rings, recommendations, network/topology) | Not optimized for wide OLTP; different scaling model; specialized skill set/licensing |
| **Other quick picks** | | Redis: ultra-fast cache/leaderboards; Snowflake/BigQuery: analytics; Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: search/logs | Use per specialized need | Each adds infra/ops cost; keep surface area small |

**How to decide quickly:** Start with PostgreSQL or MySQL for most OLTP apps; pick DynamoDB/Cassandra when horizontal write scaling and simple access patterns dominate; choose MongoDB for flexible schemas without heavy joins; reach for graph (Neo4j) only when relationships are the core query.

### Read Replicas vs Sharding

| Aspect | Read Replicas | Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning) | When to Use |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Scale read throughput | Scale both reads and writes; handle large datasets | Use replicas for read-heavy; sharding for write-heavy or large data |
| **Write Scaling** | No (all writes go to primary) | Yes (writes distributed across shards) | Sharding when write traffic exceeds single DB capacity |
| **Read Scaling** | Yes (distribute reads across replicas) | Yes (each shard handles subset of reads) | Both scale reads; replicas simpler for read-only scaling |
| **Data Size** | All data on each replica | Data partitioned across shards | Sharding when data doesn't fit on single node |
| **Complexity** | Low (just replication setup) | High (partition key selection, rebalancing, cross-shard queries) | Replicas for simplicity; sharding when necessary for scale |
| **Consistency** | Replication lag (eventual consistency for reads) | Depends on implementation; can be strong per shard | Both have consistency tradeoffs |
| **Failure Impact** | Read capacity reduced; primary still handles writes | Shard unavailable affects subset of data | Replicas: graceful degradation; Sharding: partial outage |

**Why Choose Read Replicas:**
- Read:write ratio is 10:1 or higher (news sites, blogs, product catalogs)
- Need to offload reporting/analytics queries from primary
- Geographic distribution of read traffic
- Simple to implement and maintain

**Why Choose Sharding:**
- Write throughput exceeds single database capacity (high-frequency trading, IoT ingestion)
- Dataset size exceeds single server storage (multi-TB datasets)
- Need to isolate tenant data (multi-tenant SaaS)
- Combined with replicas for maximum scale

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Replicas: Easy to implement + Read scalability ↔ No write scaling
- Sharding: Write + Read scalability + Large data ↔ High complexity, cross-shard queries difficult

### Normalization vs Denormalization

| Aspect | Normalization | Denormalization | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Data Redundancy** | Minimal (DRY principle) | High (data duplicated) | Normalize to save storage; denormalize for performance |
| **Write Performance** | Faster (single location update) | Slower (update multiple locations) | Normalize for write-heavy; denormalize for read-heavy |
| **Read Performance** | Slower (requires joins) | Faster (pre-joined data) | Denormalize for low-latency reads |
| **Data Integrity** | Easier (single source of truth) | Harder (risk of inconsistency) | Normalize for critical data accuracy |
| **Storage Cost** | Lower | Higher | Normalize when storage is expensive; denormalize when reads are expensive |
| **Use Case** | OLTP (transactional systems) | OLAP (analytics, reporting), NoSQL databases | |

**Why Choose Normalization:**
- Data integrity is critical (user accounts, financial records)
- Write-heavy workload (frequent updates to same entities)
- Storage costs are high
- Data changes frequently

**Why Choose Denormalization:**
- Read performance is critical (newsfeed, product search)
- Read:write ratio is very high
- Willing to sacrifice consistency for speed
- Pre-computed aggregations needed (dashboards, leaderboards)

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Normalization: Data integrity + Storage efficiency ↔ Slow reads (joins)
- Denormalization: Fast reads ↔ Data redundancy + Update complexity

## Caching Strategies

### Cache Aside vs Write-Through vs Write-Behind

| Strategy | How It Works | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Cache Aside (Lazy Loading)** | App checks cache first; on miss, loads from DB and populates cache | Simple; cache contains only requested data; resilient to cache failures | Initial request is slow (cache miss); stale data possible | Read-heavy with unpredictable access patterns (user profiles, product pages) |
| **Write-Through** | App writes to cache and DB synchronously | Cache always consistent with DB; read hits are fast | Write latency (two writes); wasted cache space for unread data | Read-heavy with critical consistency (inventory, pricing) |
| **Write-Behind (Write-Back)** | App writes to cache; cache asynchronously writes to DB | Fast writes; reduced DB load; batch writes possible | Risk of data loss if cache fails; eventual consistency | Write-heavy with acceptable data loss risk (analytics events, logs) |
| **Refresh-Ahead** | Cache proactively refreshes before expiration | Reduced latency; no cache miss penalty | Wasted resources if data not accessed; complex to implement | Predictable access patterns (homepage, trending content) |

**Why Choose Each:**
- **Cache Aside**: Most flexible and common pattern; works when you don't know what to cache upfront
- **Write-Through**: Need strong consistency between cache and DB
- **Write-Behind**: Extremely high write throughput needed, can tolerate data loss
- **Refresh-Ahead**: Predictable access patterns, zero cache miss tolerance

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Cache Aside: Flexibility + Resilience ↔ Cache misses, stale data
- Write-Through: Consistency ↔ Write latency
- Write-Behind: Write performance ↔ Data loss risk, complexity

## Storage Tradeoffs

### Object Storage vs Block Storage vs File Storage

| Aspect | Object Storage (S3) | Block Storage (EBS) | File Storage (EFS/NFS) | When to Use |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Access Pattern** | HTTP API (REST) | Direct block access | File system (POSIX) | Object: web/API; Block: DB; File: shared access |
| **Performance** | High throughput, moderate IOPS | Very high IOPS, low latency | Moderate throughput, good for concurrent access | Block for databases; Object for media; File for shared workloads |
| **Scalability** | Unlimited (horizontal) | Limited by volume size | Scales automatically (petabytes) | Object for massive scale; Block for single-instance; File for multi-instance |
| **Cost** | Lowest ($/GB) | Moderate to high | Moderate (higher than Object) | Object for archival; Block for performance; File for shared |
| **Use Cases** | Static assets, backups, data lakes | Databases, boot volumes | Shared code, content management | |

**Why Choose Object Storage:**
- Static website assets, backups, data lakes
- Cost-effective at massive scale
- Global distribution via CDN

**Why Choose Block Storage:**
- Database storage, high-IOPS applications
- Low-latency requirements

**Why Choose File Storage:**
- Shared access across multiple servers
- Content management systems, ML training data

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Object: Unlimited scale + Low cost ↔ Higher latency
- Block: High performance ↔ Limited scale
- File: Shared access ↔ Higher cost

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Aspect | Synchronous (HTTP/gRPC) | Asynchronous (Message Queue) | When to Use |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Coupling** | Tight (caller waits) | Loose (fire and forget) | Sync: real-time; Async: decouple services |
| **Latency** | Low (immediate response) | Higher (eventual processing) | Sync: user-facing; Async: background jobs |
| **Reliability** | Retry in caller | Built-in retry, DLQ | Async for mission-critical tasks |
| **Scalability** | Limited (caller blocks) | High (queue absorbs spikes) | Async for traffic spikes |

**Why Choose Synchronous:**
- User needs immediate response (login, search)
- Simple request-response workflows
- Low latency critical

**Why Choose Asynchronous:**
- Long-running tasks (video transcoding)
- Decouple services for resilience
- Handle traffic spikes

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Sync: Simple + Immediate ↔ Tight coupling
- Async: Decoupling + Scalability ↔ Complexity

### Client Updates: Short Polling vs Long Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events (SSE)

| Aspect | Short Polling | Long Polling | WebSockets | SSE |
|--------|---------------|--------------|------------|-----|
| **Connection Model** | Client polls on interval (e.g., every 5s) | Client holds request open until data or timeout, then re-issues | Full-duplex persistent TCP (via HTTP upgrade) | One-way server → client over persistent HTTP |
| **Latency** | Interval-based; higher if interval large | Low; server responds immediately when data ready | Very low; bi-directional | Low; server pushes as events occur |
| **Server Load** | Many requests; wasted when nothing changes | Fewer requests; each may tie up a worker until data | Few connections; efficient after handshake | Few connections; efficient for push |
| **Scalability Pain** | High QPS, connection overhead | Thread/conn held per client; needs async IO | Many open sockets; needs load balancers/proxies that handle sticky/WS | Many open connections; similar infra to WS but simpler |
| **Use When** | Simple/low-traffic; no server push needed | Need near-real-time but infra limited to HTTP; moderate scale | Interactive, two-way updates (chat, games, collab) | Real-time, server-to-client only (tickers, notifications, logs) |
| **Drawbacks** | Wasted cycles, stale data between polls | Holding connections; timeouts; intermediate proxies can drop | More complex protocol, connection mgmt, backpressure | One-way only; older browsers need polyfills; retry/backoff handling |
| **Examples** | CRON-like dashboard refresh | Live score updates without WS/SSE support | Chat apps, multiplayer games, collaborative docs | Stock quotes, live comments, monitoring dashboards |

**How to choose:**
- Start with long polling if you need push-ish behavior but are limited to plain HTTP and modest scale.
- Use WebSockets for interactive, high-frequency bi-directional flows or when clients need to push frequently.
- Use SSE for server-to-client streaming where simplicity and HTTP semantics matter (auto-reconnect, events).
- Reserve short polling for low-QPS or legacy paths where real-time is not critical and change rate is low.

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Short Polling: Easiest to add ↔ Latency + wasted requests at scale
- Long Polling: Near-real-time over HTTP ↔ Held connections, proxy timeouts
- WebSockets: Full-duplex + lowest latency ↔ Infra complexity (sticky sessions, scaling, backpressure)
- SSE: Simple server→client push ↔ One-way only, needs reconnect logic

### Chaos Engineering Levels (Netflix Playbook)

| Tool | What It Does | When to Use | Notes/Tradeoffs |
|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Chaos Monkey** | Terminates random servers/instances | Every service; baseline resiliency validation | Catches single-instance brittleness; assumes stateless or fast reattach to state |
| **Chaos Gorilla** | Simulates losing an entire AZ | Critical systems where downtime hits revenue/reputation | Validates multi-AZ design, autoscaling, and failover runbooks |
| **Chaos Kong** | Simulates losing an entire region | Rare; only for global, highest-availability systems | Expensive to practice; requires active-active or warm standby cross-region |

**Context:** Netflix can run these because services are mostly stateless, globally aware, and designed for availability from day one (multi-AZ/region, retries, circuit breakers, resilient data stores).

**Practical guidance:**
- Monkey: default for all services; start here to harden base reliability.
- Gorilla: enable for revenue/brand-critical paths once multi-AZ is proven.
- Kong: usually overkill; reserve for globally distributed, tier-0 systems with cross-region architecture and clear blast-radius controls.

## Scalability Patterns

### Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

| Aspect | Vertical (Scale Up) | Horizontal (Scale Out) | When to Use |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Approach** | Bigger server | More servers | Vertical: quick fix; Horizontal: long-term |
| **Limit** | Hardware limit | Virtually unlimited | Horizontal when vertical hits limits |
| **Cost** | Non-linear | Linear | Horizontal more cost-effective at scale |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Complex (distributed) | Vertical for simplicity |
| **Downtime** | Required | Zero (rolling) | Horizontal for high availability |

**Why Choose Vertical:**
- Quick wins, legacy apps, starting out

**Why Choose Horizontal:**
- High availability, predictable costs, massive scale

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Vertical: Simple ↔ Limited, expensive
- Horizontal: Unlimited scale ↔ Complexity

## Consistency vs Availability

### CAP Theorem Tradeoffs

| Choice | Guarantees | Sacrifice | Use Cases |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **CP** | Consistency + Partition Tolerance | Availability | Banking, inventory, auctions |
| **AP** | Availability + Partition Tolerance | Consistency | Social feeds, analytics, caching |

**Why Choose CP:**
- Financial transactions, inventory management
- Data correctness > uptime

**Why Choose AP:**
- Social media, real-time analytics
- Uptime > immediate consistency

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- CP: Data correctness ↔ May be unavailable
- AP: Always available ↔ Stale data possible

## Data Processing

### Batch vs Stream Processing

| Aspect | Batch | Stream | When to Use |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Latency** | High (hours) | Low (milliseconds) | Batch: reports; Stream: real-time |
| **Volume** | Large | Small (per record) | Batch: historical; Stream: live |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | Complex | Batch for simplicity |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher | Batch for cost-sensitive |

**Why Choose Batch:**
- Daily reports, ML training, ETL jobs
- Cost-effective for non-time-sensitive

**Why Choose Stream:**
- Real-time fraud detection, live dashboards
- Event-driven architectures

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Batch: Cost-effective ↔ High latency
- Stream: Low latency ↔ Higher cost, complexity

## Architecture Patterns

### Monolith vs Microservices

| Aspect | Monolith | Microservices | When to Use |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Deployment** | Single unit | Multiple services | Monolith: startups; Microservices: mature |
| **Scalability** | Scale entire app | Scale independently | Microservices: heterogeneous scaling |
| **Development** | Simple | Complex | Monolith: small teams |
| **Fault Isolation** | Entire app | Service-level | Microservices: resilience |

**Why Choose Monolith:**
- Early-stage startup, small team, simple domain

**Why Choose Microservices:**
- Large org, distinct domains, team autonomy

**Tradeoff Summary:**
- Monolith: Simplicity ↔ Limited scalability
- Microservices: Independent scaling ↔ Complexity
